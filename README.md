### Question 2: What is your idea of right action in any given situation? Give an example to illustrate your answer. (5 marks)

**Answer:**
Right action involves making decisions based on ethics, empathy, and the greater good, even if it requires personal sacrifice. For example, if someone sees a stray animal injured on the road, taking the time to get it medical help rather than ignoring it is a right action. Such acts of kindness reflect compassion and moral responsibility. It requires critical thinking and the courage to stand by what is morally correct. For instance, if a friend asks for help in cheating during an exam, refusing to assist them is the right action. Although it may strain the friendship temporarily, it upholds the values of honesty and fairness.

**Hinglish Explanation:**
Right action ka matlab hai kisi bhi paristhiti mein apne vyavhaar ko aise chune jo ethical aur samaj ke hit mein ho. Maan lijiye ek dost aap se exam mein cheating karwane ko kehta hai; uski madad na karna sahi faisla hoga, kyunki yeh imandari aur nyay ko support karta hai. Aise faisle lene ke liye himmat aur soojh-boojh ki zarurat hoti hai.

**Answer:**
During an Ethics and Culture session, our group organized a "Clean Campus Drive" to promote cleanliness and environmental awareness.

We divided tasks such as collecting waste, planting saplings, and educating others on proper waste disposal. The activity taught me teamwork, responsibility, and the importance of small steps in achieving a larger goal. It also instilled a sense of pride in contributing to the environment.

**Hinglish Explanation:**
Ek baar hamari class mein "Clean Campus Drive" ka ayojan kiya gaya tha. Hamne team mein kaam kiya jisme kachra uthana, paudhe lagana aur waste disposal ke baare mein jagrukta failana shamil tha. Is activity ne mujhe teamwork aur zimmedari ka mahatva samjhaya. Is prakriya se mujhe paryavaran ke prati yogdan dene ki khushi mili.
