### Question 1: Write short notes on any two of the following. (5x2=10)

#### (i) The Idea of Social Justice in *"Panch Parmeshwar"*  
**Answer:**  
Premchand’s story *“Panch Parmeshwar”* shows the importance of fairness and justice over personal relationships. The story is about two friends, Jumman and Algu, who act as Panchayat leaders in cases involving each other.  

Even though they are close friends, they give fair decisions based on truth instead of favoring their friendship. This reflects how the Panchayat system, as described by Premchand, ensures justice and fairness for everyone. The story teaches that a Panchayat leader should always stand for what is right to keep peace and harmony in the community.  

**Hinglish Explanation:**  
Premchand ki kahani *“Panch Parmeshwar”* mein nyay aur samajik insaaf ka mahatva dikhaya gaya hai. Jumman aur Algu apne rishte aur dosti ke bawjood sach aur nyay ka saath dete hain. Yeh kahani sikhati hai ki Panchayat ka uddeshya samaj mein shanti aur vishwas banaye rakhna hai.

#### (ii) Mindfulness  
**Answer:**  
Mindfulness means being fully aware of the present moment without judging your thoughts or feelings. It helps people feel calmer, reduce stress, and improve focus. You can practice mindfulness through meditation, deep breathing, or paying attention to small daily activities like eating or walking.  

For example, starting your day with 10 minutes of meditation can make you feel more focused and positive. Mindfulness encourages people to live in the moment, stay aware of their feelings, and handle challenges calmly.  

**Hinglish Explanation:**  
Mindfulness ka matlab hai apne vartaman mein poori jagrukta ke saath rehna. Meditation aur deep breathing jaise aasan tareeqe se stress kam hota hai aur vyakti ko adhik focused banata hai.

### Question 2: What is your idea of right action in any given situation? Give an example to illustrate your answer. (5 marks)

**Answer:**  
Right action means making decisions that are ethical and benefit others. It involves being honest, kind, and thinking about the greater good, even if it is difficult.  

For example, if you see an injured stray animal, helping it and taking it for medical care is a right action. Similarly, refusing to help a friend cheat in an exam is also the right thing to do. It shows honesty and fairness, even if it temporarily upsets your friend. Right actions help build trust and make society better.  

**Hinglish Explanation:**  
Right action ka matlab hai ethical aur doosron ke hit mein faisla lena. Agar ek dost aapse cheating karne ko kehta hai aur aap mana karte ho, toh yeh sahi kadam hoga kyunki yeh imandari aur nyay ko badhava deta hai.

### Question 3: Elaborate any one individual/group activity that you did in the class and that had a deep impact on you. Give reasons to substantiate your answer. (5 marks)

**Answer:**  
One memorable group activity I participated in was the “Clean Campus Drive.” We aimed to promote cleanliness and make students and teachers more aware of protecting the environment.  

During the drive, we collected waste, planted saplings, and talked to others about separating and disposing of trash properly. Initially, some classmates were not interested, but our teamwork inspired them to join.  

This activity taught me the importance of teamwork and how small efforts can bring big changes. It felt good to help the environment and see others become more aware of cleanliness.  

**Hinglish Explanation:**  
Ek Ethics session ke dauran hamne “Clean Campus Drive” ka ayojan kiya. Hamne safai aur kachra alag karne ke bare mein awareness badhayi aur teamwork ke mahatva ko samjha. Yeh activity mujhe samajik yogdan ka mahatva sikhati hai.

### Question 4: Which shared value do you think has the most relevance in the present times? Discuss. (5 marks)

**Answer:**  
Empathy, or understanding others’ feelings, is very important today. In times of social inequality and global problems, empathy helps us connect with others and work together for solutions.  

For example, during COVID-19, people helped each other by donating food, money, or just supporting their neighbors. Empathy makes it possible to reduce prejudice, solve conflicts, and build a better society. It teaches us to respect others and work for the common good.  

**Hinglish Explanation:**  
Aaj ke samay mein empathy yaani doosron ke dukh-sukh samajhne ki shamta bohot zaroori hai. COVID-19 ke dauran logon ka ek doosre ki madad karna aur samaj mein ekta banana iski importance ko dikhata hai.
