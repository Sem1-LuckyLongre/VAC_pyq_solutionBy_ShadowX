### Question 1: Write short notes on any two of the following. (5x2=10)

#### (i) The Idea of Social Justice in *"Panch Parmeshwar"*  
**Answer:**  
Premchand’s story *“Panch Parmeshwar”* explores the core principle of social justice, which prioritizes fairness, truth, and impartiality over personal biases. The story revolves around two friends, Jumman and Algu, who serve as Panchayat leaders in disputes involving each other. Despite their personal relationship, they uphold justice above all.  

When Jumman presides over a case where Algu is the accused, and vice versa, both deliver decisions that favor the truth rather than their friendship. This showcases how the Panchayat system, as depicted by Premchand, embodies the ideal of social justice by transcending personal relationships and ensuring unbiased verdicts for community welfare. The story emphasizes the moral responsibility of a Panchayat leader to uphold the values of equity and integrity, highlighting the relevance of community-led justice systems in maintaining harmony and order in society.  

**Hinglish Explanation:**  
Premchand ki kahani *“Panch Parmeshwar”* mein nyay aur samajik insaaf ka mahatva dikhaya gaya hai. Kahani ke kirdar Jumman aur Algu, apne rishte aur dosti ke bawjood, Panchayat mein hamesha sachai aur nyay ke saath khade hote hain. Yeh kahani sikhati hai ki Panchayat ka mool uddeshya samaj mein vishwas aur samanvay banaye rakhna hai.

#### (ii) Mindfulness  
**Answer:**  
Mindfulness is the art of being fully present in the moment, with complete awareness and non-judgmental acceptance of one’s thoughts, emotions, and surroundings. It promotes a deeper connection with oneself and the world, enhancing emotional well-being and reducing stress. Mindfulness can be cultivated through practices like meditation, deep breathing, and mindful observation of daily activities, such as eating, walking, or listening.  

For instance, beginning the day with ten minutes of meditation can improve focus and emotional regulation, while practicing gratitude fosters a positive outlook on life. Mindfulness encourages individuals to detach from distractions, improve self-awareness, and respond thoughtfully to challenges. It is widely recognized for its benefits in improving concentration, mental health, and interpersonal relationships.  

**Hinglish Explanation:**  
Mindfulness ka arth hai apne vartaman mein poori jagrukta aur swikriti ke saath rehna. Ismein bina kisi judgement ke apne vicharon aur aas-paas ke halat ko apnana shamil hai. Meditation, deep breathing aur gratitude practice mindfulness ke mahatvapurn ang hain jo stress kam karte hain aur vyakti ko adhik sukhad aur santulit banate hain.

### Question 2: What is your idea of right action in any given situation? Give an example to illustrate your answer. (5 marks)

**Answer:**  
Right action refers to decisions and behaviors guided by ethics, empathy, and consideration for the greater good. It requires critical thinking, selflessness, and moral courage, especially when personal stakes are involved.  

For instance, if someone encounters an injured stray animal on the road, stopping to help and ensuring it receives medical attention is a right action. Such an act reflects compassion and a sense of responsibility toward others. Similarly, refusing to assist a friend in cheating during an exam is another example of right action. While it may temporarily harm the friendship, it upholds values like honesty, integrity, and fairness, which are fundamental to building trust and a just society.  

**Hinglish Explanation:**  
Right action ka matlab hai ethical aur samaj ke hit mein faisle lena. Maan lijiye, ek dost aapse exam mein cheating karne ko kehta hai; uski madad karne ke bajay usse mana karna sahi kadam hoga. Yeh imandari aur nyay ko badhava deta hai, jo ek vyakti aur samaj ke liye aavashyak hai.

### Question 3: Elaborate any one individual/group activity that you did in the class and that had a deep impact on you. Give reasons to substantiate your answer. (5 marks)

**Answer:**  
One impactful group activity I participated in was a “Clean Campus Drive” conducted during an Ethics and Environment session. Our goal was to promote cleanliness and raise awareness about environmental sustainability among students and faculty.  

During the drive, we faced challenges like initial disinterest from classmates and resistance to adopting sustainable habits. However, by organizing ourselves into small teams, we divided tasks such as collecting waste, planting saplings, and conducting awareness campaigns on waste segregation and disposal.  

This activity deeply impacted me as it taught me the value of teamwork, perseverance, and responsibility. It also reinforced the importance of collective effort in driving social change. The satisfaction of contributing to the environment and seeing positive changes in attitudes toward cleanliness made the experience meaningful.  

**Hinglish Explanation:**  
Ek Ethics aur Environment session ke dauran hamne “Clean Campus Drive” ka ayojan kiya. Hamara lakshya safai aur paryavaran sanrakshan ke prati jagrukta badhana tha. Hamne kachra ikattha karne, paudhe lagane aur proper waste disposal ke liye awareness campaigns kiye. Is activity ne mujhe samuhik kaam aur samajik badlav mein yogdan dene ka mahatva samjhaya.

### Question 4: Which shared value do you think has the most relevance in the present times? Discuss. (5 marks)

**Answer:**  
Empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, holds paramount relevance in today’s world. In an era marked by social inequalities, conflicts, and global crises, empathy serves as the foundation for building inclusive, harmonious, and cooperative societies.  

For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, acts of kindness such as helping neighbors, donating essentials, and supporting frontline workers highlighted the power of empathy in overcoming adversity. Empathy enables individuals to address societal challenges like poverty, mental health issues, and discrimination with compassion and collaboration.  

By fostering mutual respect and understanding, empathy encourages people to look beyond their differences and work together for the common good. Its role in promoting peace, reducing prejudice, and addressing global issues underscores its importance as a shared value in contemporary times.  

**Hinglish Explanation:**  
Aaj ke samay mein empathy yaani doosron ke dukh-sukh ko samajhne aur mehsoos karne ki shamta ek atyant mahatvapurn value hai. COVID-19 ke dauran, logo ka ek dusre ki madad karna aur samaj ke prati yogdan karna empathy ka ek udaharan tha. Yeh samaj mein mel-jol, samanta aur samvedna ka sanrachak hai. Empathy ke bina vyakti aur samaj ka vikas asambhav hai.
